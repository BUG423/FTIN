In recent years, the application of machine learning in inertial navigation has made significant progress, with positioning accuracy surpassing that of traditional Newtonian mechanics methods. This paper proposes a network architecture that integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features to improve the accuracy of displacement and velocity predictions. Experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of this method, particularly on the RONIN dataset, where the absolute trajectory error and relative trajectory error were reduced by 43.0% and 2.2%, respectively, compared to the baseline model.

To protect the results of the paper, we will release the core code after the paper is officially accepted. We appreciate your understanding.
